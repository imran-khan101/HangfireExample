# Building a .NET Core 8 API with Hangfire and SQL Server

This project demonstrates how to create a .NET Core 8 API that integrates Hangfire for background job processing and uses SQL Server for job storage. The project includes a simple API that allows you to enqueue and schedule background jobs, along with a Hangfire Dashboard for monitoring and managing those jobs.

## Introduction

Hangfire is a powerful library that simplifies background job processing in .NET applications. It's particularly useful for tasks such as sending emails, processing data, scheduling cleanup tasks, triggering notifications, and automating maintenance jobs.

In this project, you will learn how to:

- Set up a .NET Core 8 Web API project.
- Integrate Hangfire for background job processing.
- Use SQL Server to persist Hangfire jobs.
- Monitor and manage jobs using the Hangfire Dashboard.
